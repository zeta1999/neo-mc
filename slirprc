% Automatically fill `size` argument with the size ($1_dim'ension) of the `items`.
#argmap (in,which=1) (char **items, unsigned long size)
   $2 = ($2_type) $1_dim1;
#end

% Same for other array/size pair.
#argmap (in,which=1) (char **data, unsigned long size2)
   $2 = ($2_type) $1_dim1;
#end

% Ignore symbols, i.e.: do not export them to S-Lang interpreter.
#ignore
    MC__SLANG_API_FUNCTIONS_H
#end

% Remove the unwanted function name prefixes from S-Lang exported functions.
% Not working, have to use the command line -rename option as it understands `NULL`.
%#rename slang_api__ NULL
%#rename keybind_ NULL
