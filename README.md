# ━͞━ ⋱Neo⋱ Midnight Commander ━͞━

Welcome to the ⋱Neo⋱-MC project! The goals of it are to:

- make the hidden gem – mcedit – shine and grow to be able to compete with Vim and Emacs,
- add a scripting language to mcedit and mc to make this possible,
- add some meaningful plugins written in the scripting language.

Check out [MCEditWishList](https://github.com/neo-mc/neo-mc/wiki/MCEditWishList) for a curated list
of the planned enhancements. Maybe you would want to implement one of them? Because patches are
welcomed, so as are new contributors.
